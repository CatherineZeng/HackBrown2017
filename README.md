# HackBrown2017
Vox.io is a webapp that allows you to remotely control your computer through voice command. Our hackathon group for Hack Brown consists of Catherine Zeng, Jingwei Ma, and Robert Henning
We were the runner up for the Best Microsoft prize.

We used the Bing Speech API from Microsoft Cognitive services.

vox.io sets up a web app, gives a url, and allows you to control the host computer through voice command.
to use vox.io, run iochatcmd.py and go to https://true.localtunnel.me/ to say your command.

iochat uses modules subprocess, os, time, webbrowser, string, urllib, urllib2, BeautifulSoup, and evdev
